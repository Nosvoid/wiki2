            <p>It's a brand new system where you will face Stone Type monsters and you will need special items to fight against them. You will always hit 10,000 to Stone Type monsters as base damage. Your equipment or what you wear doesn't matter. You need to have items with "Increased damage to stone type monsters by x%" buffs. You can craft Helmet, Mask, Accessories, Resistances and Amulet with these mentioned buffs. You can upgrade these until +5. (Upgrade chance is 100% to success) or you can simply get Premium Versions of the mentioned items from Fortune Wheel which gives "Increased damage to stone type monsters by 150%" and these aren't upgradeable.</p>
            <p>Stone Upgrade Scroll can be crafted in Stone Area. You can see the amount of materials from the picture.</p>
