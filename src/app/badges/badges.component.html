            <h2>What is a Badge ?</h2>
            <p>
                The badge is a NosVoid custom feature. It's basically an additional shell with custom 
                options you can put on your character. It will take the amulet spot in your character window (P).
            </p>

            <h2>How to get your badge ?</h2>
            <p>
                You can buy a badge in the Badge Room map in NosVille. It costs 1b Gold and you can have 5 
                badges maximum per character.
            </p>

            <h2>How to upgrade/bet your badge ?</h2>
            <p>When you buy your badge, it's r0+0. You can upgrade and bet your badge until r8+10.</p>

            <h3>Bet :</h3>
            <p>
                You need to use Rarify Item to increase the rarity of the badge. 
                Rarify Items can be crafted at Rarify Craft NPCs in Badge Room or you can get them 
                in some raid boxes or Fortune Wheel. <br>
                If you're lucky, it will be easy, if not, it will be expensive. Once you reach r8, every 
                single rarify item you use on your badge has a 100% chance to change your options. You can 
                now start to bet your badge in order to get the options you want on it.
            </p>

            <h3>Upgrade :</h3>
            <p>
                You need to use Upgrade Item to increase the "level" of the badge. Upgrade Items can be crafted 
                at Upgrade Craft NPC in Badge Room or you can get them in some raid boxes or Fortune Wheel. <br>
                Again, if you're lucky, it will be easy, if not, it will be expensive. Upgrading the badge 
                will increase the option values. You can upgrade your badge to +10 maximum.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What is Badge Evolution ?</h2>
            <p>It is an item that evolves your badge and grants you 2 new extra stats to help you on your journey. <br />
                You can craft required items to evolve your badge in the $warp p4 Soul System portal.<br />

                <br />From badge evolution, you can get the following effects:
                <br />
                <br /><li>- All Attack are increased by %: 2 - 3 - 5 - 6 - 8</li>
                <li>- All Defenses are increased by %: 2 - 3 - 5 - 6 - 8</li>
                <li>- All cooldowns are decreased by %: 4 - 6 - 8 - 10 - 12</li>
                <li>- Damage in raid is increased by %: 4 - 6 - 8 - 10 - 12</li>
                <li>- All Attack/Defense/Property perfections are increased by: 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 10</li>
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">Note: You can change these stats by using the <strong>"Evolution Badge Rarify Changer"</strong> item.</p>
